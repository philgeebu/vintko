        <h2>What is Vintko?</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                Welcome to Vintko! My name is Phil, and I'm a collector of vintage Seiko watches and a wanna-be amateur
                photographer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Up until getting engaged in 2019, I <em>never</em> cared for watches. I had my box full of
                outfit-matching Kenneth Cole jams with dead batteries, and that was all I needed. During the
                engagement, my in-laws insisted on gifting me a nice watch as tradition, but I refused because
                nice watches were a complete waste of money to me.
            </p>
            <p>
                While shopping, the wife pulled me into a department store to <q>just pick something.</q> As enticing
                as the Hugo Boss models were, I went home to do some research before blindly grabbing something. The
                next 12 hours pretty-much changed my life. I locked onto #Seiko and scoured Amazon, landing on the
                green Alpinist. At that point, I was addicted; subreddits, forums, Facebook groups, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                After learning a lot about Seiko, I started connecting dots and wondered if <em>(hoped)</em> the
                watch my dad wore when I was young was a Seiko. Well... we visited my dad during our honeymoon, and he
                gifted me a 1984 6309-7290 <q>Slim Turtle</q> that he purchased new in Singapore.
            </p>
            <p>
                It will forever be a staple in the collection; it means a lot to me. I also ended up inheriting my
                late grandfather's watch: another Seiko!
            </p>
            <p>
                Seiko is extremely special to me, and Vintko is a product of my obsession.
